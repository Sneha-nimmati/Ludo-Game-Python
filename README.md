# About the Game

#### <b>LUDO</b> is a game for 2-4 players. Each player is represented by a different color (red, green, blue, and yellow) and has 4 coins that start at the corresponding home position on the board.

#### The objective of the game is to move all of your coins from your initial position to the final destination (the "finish" area) before the other players do.

#### The game is played by rolling a six-sided dice. The number on the dice determines how many spaces you can move one of your coins. You can choose which coin to move based on the number rolled and the current positions of your coins.

#### Once a coin is on the board, it can be "killed" by another player's coin if that player's coin lands on the same space. In that case, the killed coin must return to its home position and start again.

#### The first player to move all of their coins to the finish area wins the game.
